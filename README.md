# Schad_CSCI2270_FinalProject
My final project for CSCI 2270 (Data Structures) at CU Boulder.

Project Summary:
This is meant to be used by a customer going to a movie theater. The .txt file I have created has different movies listed that is then parsed, creating a hash table of movies and their showtimes. A user can then choose to see what movies are playing, when they are playing, and sort by showtimes, titles, and much more. Another exciting feature is the "double feature" option, where a user can insert the titles of two movies they want to see in the same day, and the program automatically calculates all screening options between those two movies which do not conflict. Finally, I have randomized options, where the program will pick a movie and showtime at random, or even go so far as to pick a series of films randomly that do not have any time conflicts. Overall I'm very happy with my program, and hopefully it's easy to use and useful!

How to Run:
In case you're using CodeBlocks, I have made an ultimate .zip file that you can download. If you ONLY want the essential code, download the OTHER files I included in this repo. So if you download the .zip folder you will not need anything else to get it running properly. Once inside, if you run it like a regular program (make sure MovieHash.h and MovieHash.cpp are in the correct locations), it should present you with a menu just like our in-class assignments. From there, you may continue to choose different options until you choose option 7, which is "quit." Another important note-- make sure all times entered are in military time! Ex. 8:00AM would be entered as "800," while 8:00PM would be entered as "2000."

Dependencies:
I use several libraries in this project, but they should all be properly included already in the files.

System Requirements:
There are no system restrictions.

Group Members:
Tyler Schad

Contributors:

Open issues/bugs:
There are a few efficiency programs I hope to fix in the future, but there isn't anything that should keep my project from working properly at any time. I'd be open to feedback in the area, however!

Again, thanks for checking out my project!
