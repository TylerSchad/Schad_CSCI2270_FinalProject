# Schad_CSCI2270_FinalProject
My final project for CSCI 2270 (Data Structures) at CU Boulder.

I plan on creating a scheduling program for watching films at a theater. I will create a text document listing different films and showtimes for one theater, and then allow the user to input which films they would like to see. The program will then automatically provide them with showtimes that will allow them to watch all of the films they wanted without overlap, or if there is no option without overlap, it will break the showtimes into multiple days and provide the user with that option. I plan on using stacks and linked lists to make the schedules in a way that won't allow for any overlapping of time, as well as something similar to a "shortest path" algorithm to schedule efficiently as possible. I am also interested in including additional functionalities surrounding the filmgoing experience (calculating cost, finding the MOST number of movies a person could attend in the given schedule in a day, etc.).
